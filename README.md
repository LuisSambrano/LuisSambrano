# Luis Sambrano
> **System Architect | Rust & React Engineering | AI Integration**

I build high-performance distributed systems and "Quiet Luxury" user interfaces. My work focuses on bridging the gap between low-level system efficiency (Rust) and premium functional aesthetics (React/TypeScript).

## 💎 Featured Personal Projects (Open Source)

These projects demonstrate my core engineering philosophy: **Local First. Private. Beautiful.**

### [Invoice Zero](https://github.com/LuisSambrano/invoice-zero)

**Status**: 🟢 Production Ready | **Stack**: Tauri v2, Rust, SQLite, React 19

> A "Unicorn-Tier" desktop application for invoicing. Built with a local-first architecture using Rust for the system core and React for a "Deep Space" glassmorphism UI. Zero telemetry, 100% offline.

### [Dolar API Luxury](https://github.com/LuisSambrano/dolar-api)

**Status**: 🟢 Live | **Stack**: Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion

> A financial intelligence dashboard re-imagined. Fetches real-time market data with a "Solid Glass" aesthetic, featuring spring-physics animations and atomic component architecture.
