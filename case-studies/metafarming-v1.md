# 🚜 METAfarming v1

> **Role**: Blockchain Architect & Frontend Engineer
> **Status**: 🔒 Private Repository (Client Work)
> **Stack**: Next.js 14, Web3.js, Solidity, Shadcn/UI

## The Challenge

The objective was to digitize the agricultural value chain, tokenizing cattle and land assets to create a transparent, liquid market for agro-investors. The platform needed to bridge the gap between traditional farming and Web3 defi mechanisms.

## The Solution

I designed the **"Quantum Agrotech"** interface: a futuristic yet accessible dashboard where users can mint, trade, and track their "Bio-Assets".

### Key Features

- **🐄 Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization**: Smart contracts representing physical cattle, updating metadata based on real-world growth and health stats.
- **🌐 Web3 Integration**: Seamless wallet connection (Metamask/Rainbow) for asset management.
- **📊 Yield Analytics**: Real-time charts projecting APY from agricultural yields vs. token staking rewards.
- **⚡ Next.js Performance**: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for SEO and instant page loads, critical for investor trust.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), TypeScript.
- **UI Library**: Shadcn/UI + Tailwind CSS.
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum/Polygon (Hardhat environment).
- **State**: Zustand for global app state.
